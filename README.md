## Setup and Local Development <a name="setup-and-local-development"></a>

#### Getting started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository using Git:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/EvgenKlo/eCommerce-Application.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   $ cd eCommerce-Application
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies (Node.js must be installed):
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
4. Start the project in development mode:
   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

These commands will clone the project to your local machine, install the necessary dependencies, and start the project in development mode.
After executing these steps, your project should be set up and running locally.

## Scripts <a name="scripts"></a>

In this section, you will find the available scripts to manage your project and instructions on how to use them.

`npm run dev`

- Starts the development server using Vite, enabling you to work on your project with hot module replacement and other development features.

`npm run build`

- Builds your project for production. It first transpiles TypeScript files using `tsc`, and then generates a production build using Vite.

`npm run lint`

- Runs ESLint to check the syntax of your TypeScript and TypeScript React files (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`) in the `src` directory. It displays errors and warnings found during the check.

`npm run lint:fix`

- Runs ESLint to check the syntax of your TypeScript and TypeScript React files (`*.ts`, `*.tsx`) in the `src` directory and automatically fixes fixable issues.

`npm run preview`

- Starts a development server that allows you to preview your project before building it for production using Vite.

`npm run prepare`

- Installs Husky, a tool used for setting up Git hooks, which allows you to run scripts automatically at certain stages of the Git workflow.

`npm run lintstaged`

- Runs lint-staged to run ESLint only on the files that were staged for commit, improving performance for pre-commit hooks.

`npm run style`

- Uses stylelint to lint your CSS files (`*.css`) in the `src` directory and report any issues found during linting.

`npm run test`

- Runs tests using `vitest`.

`npm run coverage`

- Runs a codebase test coverage check.

Feel free to use these commands to manage and develop your project.
You can run each of them by executing the respective `npm run` command in your terminal.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Before committing your changes, please follow these guidelines:

#### Commitlint

Commitlint is a tool used to enforce commit message format and rules. It applies specific rules and templates to commit messages to ensure consistency and a clear understanding of each commit's purpose.

For more information, visit the [Conventional Commits website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).

#### Code Linting

We use `ESLint` for linting JavaScript code, `Prettier` for automatic code formatting, and `Stylelint` for linting CSS code. This enables us to maintain a consistent coding style and high-quality code across the project.

Make sure your code passes the linting and formatting checks before committing.

#### Git Hooks

We have set up `Git Hooks` to automate pre-commit checks. The pre-commit hook ensures that your code passes linting and other checks before committing changes. This helps catch issues early and maintain code quality throughout the development process.

#### Deployment Restriction

To maintain a stable and organized development process, direct deployments to the `main` and `development` branches are not allowed. Instead, we follow the feature-branch workflow and create pull requests for merging changes into these branches. This approach ensures that changes are properly reviewed, tested, and approved before being merged into the main codebase.

By adhering to these guidelines and best practices, we can collaborate effectively and create high-quality code for our project.
